# 🚀 Face Detection Optimization Dashboard

**Face Detection Optimization Dashboard** is a React + TypeScript application designed to manage and monitor the optimization process of a face detection system.  
It features realistic optimization simulation, real-time monitoring, and configuration export/import capabilities.  
This project leverages the model and dataset from [ppogg/Retinaface_Ghost](https://github.com/ppogg/Retinaface_Ghost).

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Backend Logic
- **Start Optimization**
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Live logs for each optimization stage
  - Step-by-step execution (6 sequential stages)
  - Error handling & ability to stop the process
  - Display of performance metrics after completion
- **Export / Import Configuration**
  - Export configuration to JSON with complete metadata
  - Import configuration from JSON with format validation
  - Auto download with descriptive file names

### 📊 Monitoring
- Progress bar with visual stage tracking
- Live metrics: real-time performance updates
- Stage status: pending, running, completed, error
- Time tracking for each stage
- Informative and realistic log messages

### 🎯 Realistic Simulation
- 6 optimization stages (each takes 5-10 seconds)
- Randomized metrics to simulate varied results
- Detailed log messages for each stage
